# chi-squared test of goodness of fit: evaluate if the distribution of levels of a single categorical variable follows a hypothesized distribution
# chi-square test of independence: evaluating the independence of two categorical variables where at least one has more than two levels
# H0: factors are independent


# Simulation
# When sample size isn't sufficiently large, and the parameter of interest is a proportion or a difference between two proportions, we need to use simulation.
# In hypothesis:
# for one categorical variable, generate simulated samples based on the null hypothesis, and then calculate the number of samples that are at least as extreme as the observed data
# for two categorical variables, use a randomization test


# Association between two numerical variables evaluate:
# direction: positive (x ↑, y ↑), negative (x ↓, y ↑)
# form: linear or not
# strength: determined by the scatter around the underlying relationship

# The correlation coefficient is unitless and so does not change if the units of the involved variables change.
# the correlation coefficient is always between -1 and 1, -1 indicating perfect negative linear association, +1 indicating perfect positive linear association, and 0 indicating no linear relationship
# the correlation of X with Y is the same as of Y with X
# the correlation coefficient is sensitive to outliers (Pearson, use Spearman if you want robust correlation coefficinet)
# if you change units the absolute value of the slope can change, but correlation coefficient stays same

# least square line as the line that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals
# condition for fitting:
# linearity
# nearly normal residuals
# constatn variability

# R.squared = percentage of the variability in the response variable explained by the the explanatory variable

# applies a penalty for the number of predictors included in the regression model.
# Suppose you have performed forward selection using adjusted R2 as the criterion and have chosen a model with 6 predictors. Your final model has a higher adjusted R2 than any of the smaller models you tried.

# Define a leverage point as a point that lies away from the center of the data in the horizontal direction.
# Define an influential point as a point that influences (changes) the slope of the regression line. This is usually a leverage point that is away from the trajectory of the rest of the data.

# Interpretation of slope estimate; estim = beta0 + beta1 * var
# when x is numerical: For each unit increase in x, we would expect y to be lower/higher on average by |b1| units
# when x is categorical: The value of the response variable is predicted to be |b1| units higher/lower between the baseline level and the other level of the explanatory variable.
# the response variable increases or decreases is determined by the sign of b1

# SST; Sum of squares total is the total variability in the response variable.


# Multiple linear regression
# df = n - k - 1
# List the conditions for multiple linear regression
# linear relationship between each (numerical) explanatory variable and the response - checked using scatterplots of y vs. each x, and residuals plots of residuals vs. each x
# nearly normal residuals with mean 0 - checked using a normal probability plot and histogram of residuals
# constant variability of residuals - checked using residuals plots of residuals vs. y^, and residuals vs. each x
# independence of residuals (and hence observations) - checked using a scatterplot of residuals vs. order of data collection (will reveal non-independence if data have time series structure)

# parsimonious model ... The simplest model with the highest predictive power.

# collinearity ... A high correlation between two explanatory variables such that the two variables contribute redundant information to the model
